# Python Projectsüêçüë®üèæ‚Äçüíª

Welcome to my Python Projects portfolio! As an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst and Security Engineer, I‚Äôve built these projects to refine my Python skills and demonstrate my ability to tackle real-world challenges. Completing the 100 Days of Python Bootcamp gave me a strong grasp of foundational topics‚Äîsuch as data types, control flow, OOP, and file handling‚Äîwhile also exposing me to advanced concepts like API consumption, GUIs with Tkinter, web scraping, and automation.

In my day-to-day work as a Cyber Security Analyst Intern (Vulnerability Management & SecOps), Python is a key tool for automating manual processes, and streamlining security operations. Whether I‚Äôm scripting remediation steps with PowerShell or performing threat hunts in a SIEM environment, the critical thinking and problem-solving skills honed through Python development carry over to my cybersecurity tasks. These projects highlight a similar approach, emphasizing:

- **Core Python Foundations:** Variables, conditional logic, loops, functions, and OOP principles.
- **Data Handling & Analysis:** Using libraries like Pandas and CSV file manipulation to process and analyze datasets‚Äîexperience directly transferable to log analysis, vulnerability assessments, and incident response.
- **Web Development & APIs:** Flask, web scraping with Beautiful Soup or Selenium, and API integrations to build dynamic or automation-focused applications.
- **Automation & Scripting:** Streamlining routine tasks, analyzing threat data, generating reports, and exploring how Python can enhance security workflows.
- **GUI Development:** Building desktop applications with Tkinter to demonstrate user interaction and interface design skills.

Through each project, I aim to showcase clean, well-documented code, as well as the broader software engineering and security considerations‚Äîmaintainability, error handling, and secure coding practices‚Äîthat I apply in a professional environment. Please feel free to browse the code, open issues, or share feedback on any of my repositories. I‚Äôm always exploring new ways to push my skills further and welcome collaboration on Python-driven solutions for cybersecurity challenges.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope these projects demonstrate both my passion for Python and my readiness to contribute to the security landscape.
